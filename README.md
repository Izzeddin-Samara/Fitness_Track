7. üíæ **Set Up MySQL Database:**

   To set up the MySQL database for the FitnessTrack project, follow the steps below. You can use MySQL Workbench, a graphical interface for managing MySQL databases.

   1. **Download and Install MySQL Workbench:**
      - If you haven't already, download and install MySQL Workbench from the [official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

   2. **Create a New Database:**
   - Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
   - In the **Navigator** pane, right-click on **Schemas** and select **Create Schema**.
   - Name the new schema `fitnesstrack` and click **Apply**.
   - Alternatively, you can run the following command in the MySQL Query window:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE fitnesstrack;
     ```
     
   3. **Update `settings.py` file:**
   - Configure the database settings in `settings.py` file with the following:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'fitnesstrack', # The name of your database.
           'USER': 'your_mysql_username', # Your MySQL username.
           'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password', # Your MySQL password.
           'HOST': 'localhost', # The host where your MySQL database is running. Use 'localhost' if it's on your local machine.
           'PORT': '3306',  The port your MySQL server is running on. 3306 is the default MySQL port.
         }
     }
     ```
   **Notes:**

   - Ensure that your MySQL server is running, and you have the correct credentials (`your_mysql_username` and `your_mysql_password`) to access the database.
   - The database name (`fitnesstrack`) can be changed, but make sure it matches the name you set in your `settings.py`.

7. :rocket: **Run migrations to set up the database:**
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
8. :busts_in_silhouette: **Create a superuser:**
    - **Why?** Creating a superuser account is essential for accessing the Django admin interface, where you can manage the application's data and settings.

     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
