7. ðŸ’¾ **Set Up MySQL Database:**

   To set up the MySQL database for the FitnessTrack project, follow the steps below. You can use MySQL Workbench, a graphical interface for managing MySQL databases.

   1. **Download and Install MySQL Workbench:**
      - If you haven't already, download and install MySQL Workbench from the [official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

   2. **Create a New Database:**
   - Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
   - In the **Navigator** pane, right-click on **Schemas** and select **Create Schema**.
   - Name the new schema `fitnesstrack` and click **Apply**.
   - Alternatively, you can run the following command in the MySQL Query window:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE fitnesstrack;
     ```
     
   3. **Update `settings.py` file:**
   - Configure the database settings in `settings.py` file with the following:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'fitnesstrack', # The name of your database.
           'USER': 'your_mysql_username', # Your MySQL username.
           'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password', # Your MySQL password.
           'HOST': 'localhost', # The host where your MySQL database is running. Use 'localhost' if it's on your local machine.
           'PORT': '3306',  The port your MySQL server is running on. 3306 is the default MySQL port.
         }
     }
     ```
   **Notes:**

   - Ensure that your MySQL server is running, and you have the correct credentials (`your_mysql_username` and `your_mysql_password`) to access the database.
   - The database name (`fitnesstrack`) can be changed, but make sure it matches the name you set in your `settings.py`.

7. :rocket: **Run migrations to set up the database:**
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
8. :busts_in_silhouette: **Create a superuser:**
    - **Why?** Creating a superuser account is essential for accessing the Django admin interface, where you can manage the application's data and settings.
    - **How?** Run the following command
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
     - **Next Steps:** Once created, you can log in through the login page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/login. Select 'Admin' from the dropdown menu to access administrative functionalities.
10. :computer: **Run the development server:**

## :envelope: Email Setup

This section explains how to configure email functionalities in the FitnessTrack project. You can choose to set up Mailjet for sending real emails or Mailtrap for simulating email sending.

### :gear: Setting Up Mailjet for Real Emails

Use Mailjet if you need to send actual emails from the application

### Steps to Set Up Mailtjet:

1. **Sign Up and Get Your API Keys:**
   - Sign up for an account at [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com).
   - Navigate to the API section and generate your API keys (API key and Secret key).

2. **Create a `.env` File:**
   - Ensure you have a `.env` file in the project's root directory (where `manage.py` is located).

3. **Configure Mailjet in the `.env` File:**
   - Add the following lines to the `.env` file, replacing `your_value_here` with your Mailjet configuration details:
     ```plaintext
     EMAIL_BACKEND='django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
     EMAIL_HOST='in-v3.mailjet.com'
     EMAIL_PORT=587
     EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
     EMAIL_HOST_USER='your_mailjet_api_key'  # Replace with your actual Mailjet API key
     EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your_mailjet_secret_key'  # Replace with your actual Mailjet secret key
     DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL='your_email@example.com'  # Replace 'your_email@example.com' with the email address you registered with on Mailjet. This email will appear in the 'From' field when sending emails.
     ```

### :warning: Important Notes

- **Real Emails Required:** Mailjet requires valid email addresses for sending notifications. Ensure that you use real email addresses for users, coaches, contact forms, and coach applications to ensure successful delivery.

- **Single Email for All Notifications:** Utilize one email address (e.g., your_email@example.com) for sending all notifications to users, coaches, and via contact forms and coach applications. This simplifies the email setup and ensures compliance with Mailjetâ€™s policy of using verified sender addresses, enhancing deliverability and consistency across your project.

## ðŸ§ª Setting Up Mailtrap for Simulated Email Sending

Use Mailtrap if you want to simulate the process of sending emails without actual delivery. This is ideal for testing functionalities without sending real emails.

### Steps to Set Up Mailtrap:

1. **Create a Mailtrap Account:**
   - Sign up at [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io) and log in to your account.
   - Create an Inbox: Choose 'Email Testing', then create and configure a new inbox to receive simulated emails.
   - Obtain Credentials: After creating your inbox, locate the SMTP settings for the inbox which include the username and password. You'll need these for configuring your project's email settings.

2. **Add Mailtrap Settings to the `.env` File:**
   - Include the following settings in your `.env` file to configure Mailtrap for simulating emails:
     ```plaintext
     EMAIL_BACKEND='django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
     EMAIL_HOST='smtp.mailtrap.io'
     EMAIL_PORT=2525
     EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
     EMAIL_HOST_USER='your_mailtrap_username'  # Replace with your Mailtrap username
     EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your_mailtrap_password'  # Replace with your Mailtrap password
     DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL='your_test_email@example.com'  # Use this email for simulation purposes.
     ```

3. **Using Fake Emails for Testing:**
- Utilize fake email addresses for testing interactions with users, coaches, contact forms, and coach application forms. This ensures that all test emails are safely routed to your Mailtrap inbox. This setup allows you to review and validate email functionalities thoroughly without sending emails to real addresses.

### Note:
- By directing all test emails to your Mailtrap inbox, you can ensure the integrity of your testing process and protect real email addresses from receiving test data.
### Choosing the Right Configuration
- Use **Mailjet** if your goal is to send emails to actual recipients.
- Opt for **Mailtrap** if you are testing email functionalities and prefer not to send real emails.
